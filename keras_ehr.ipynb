    "In this notebook, we will implement two classifiers to predict the risk of a given surgical patient to develop postoperative Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) from a structured dataset of medical predictors. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting postoperative complications has the potential to inform shared decisions regarding the appropriateness of surgical procedures, targeted risk-reduction strategies, and postoperative resource use. Cognitive and judgment errors are major sources of potentially preventable complications. For example, underestimation of the risk of complications may be associated with postoperative undertriage of high-risk patients to general wards rather than intensive care units (ICUs) and an increased prevalence of hospital mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-performance data-based clinical decision support has the potential to mitigate harm from cognitive errors occurring when estimating the risk of postoperative complications. All patients have a unique risk profile that is specific to their demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, physiological reserve, planned surgical procedure, and surgeon’s skill; clinicians have had mediocre performance in estimating risk probabilities. Decision support tools are intended to augment these\n",
    "estimations, but many are hindered by time-consuming manual data entry requirements and lack of integration with clinical workflow. AI predictive models using automated EHR data inputs may be able to mitigate these challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on postoperative AKI complication and develop machine learning (ML) models to predict the risk."

    "\n",
    "Following are the major steps that are involved in the ML lifecycle.\n",
    "<img src=\"ML.png\" alt=\"ML lifecycle\" width=\"800\" height=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data extraction and processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant data must be extracted. For example, all revelant laboratory values and vital signs. Data quality and conformation to modeling requirements must be ensured through data preprocessing. For example, fixing the missing data, removing the unwanted outlier, and encoding the categorical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model development\n",
    "\n",
    "Using various ML algorithms, we will develop a model on a training cohort. During the model refinement stage, model parameters (such as weights and biases) are altered to optimize the associations between inputs and outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation and Intepretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a ML model is trained, we evaluate the end result on validation dataset to see how well the model performed or how reliable it is. Multiple performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity will be evaluated. Model explainability or interpretability can be explored at this stage to elucidate the relative importance of inputs. For example, lower eGFR and higher systolic blood pressure associated with outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "ML model deployment is the process of placing a finished ML model into the live environment, such as creating a web service or mobile application for prediction. It is imperative that the performance of an established model is continually monitored in prospective deployment to safeguard against population drifts or data shifts that may result in deteriorating performance over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "When new data sources are coming in or necessary steps for upgrading the performance of the ML model should be taken, we need to optimize the model by reinstructing the ML model in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will only focus on the first three phases. "

    "* Each patient profile will contain the demographic variables (age, sex, race etc.), scheduled surgery related variables (doctor, scheduled room, scheduld anesthesia type), admission characteristic variables (emergent, transfer from other hospital etc.), neighborhood charactersitic variables (zip, rural, distance_from_shands etc.), comorbidity variables (diabetes, cancer, hypertension etc.), medications taken within one year before scheduled surgery (aspirin, diuretics, statins etc.), and laboratory measurements taken within 7 days or 8 to 365 days before scheduled surgery (hemoglobin, white blood cell count etc.)\n",

    "\n",
    "Missing data are common in routinely collected health data and often missingness is informative. For example, laboratory data are often missing for intentional (e.g., the patient does not need certain laboratory tests) or unintentional (e.g., lack of routine checkup or follow-up) reasons. Estimation bias and model performance from missingness can be mitigated using imputation methods.\n",

    "Once the model is trained, we need to evaluate the performance of model on testing dataset. We first need to use our model to predict the outcome and compare the prediction with ground truth.Since our outcome is binary (0/1), for each of 2000 test samples, two values will be generated. For example, (0.7,0.3) means that the patient will have 70% chance not to develop postoperative AKI, and 30% chance to develop postoperative AKI. The class that have larger probability will be selected as the final prediction."
